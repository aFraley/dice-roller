# dice-roller
A dice rolling application written in plain, vanilla JavaScript.
This application is to be used in your web browser and is great for table-top gaming--if you happen to forget your dice.

Aside from that, it was an exercise in some of the basics in programming using JavaScript--including DOM using vanilla JavaScript.

The `assets/dev/` directory is not necessary for running that application, but is included to showcase the code. This is also true for the `gulpfile.js` or the `package.json`, which are not necessary, but included for inspection just the same.
